\begin_layout Subsection
Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ShareEnJoy is a new company that wants to enter the car sharing market and
 wants to provide a service based on electric vehicles only.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The way they want to implement their service is classical and very common
 to other car sharing services: it will be available in a specific geographical
 area (called safe area) for each city where the service will be activated.
 Users will be able to reserve and then rent a vehicle, use it for as much
 time as they desire and then be charged based on the rental time.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the car sharing service is based on electric vehicles only, the system
 must provide some specific functionalities in order to handle electric
 vehicles behaviours and needs.
 For example, the company owns some electric recharging stations spread
 among the safe area and users should be encouraged to terminate their rentals
 in these stations.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

ShareEnJoy needs a digital management system in order to support all the
 activity for both their customers and their staff operators.

The system will be composed of three main components with different roles
 and purposes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
\begin_inset Formula $\mathit{ShareEnJoy Mobile App}$
\end_inset

 This component is intended to be used by ShareEnJoy customers and will
 offer the functionality to see available vehicles in a specific geographical
 area, to reserve and then to rent a vehicle.
 It will also allow users to unlock a vehicle they have reserved when they're
 nearby.
 Through the app, users will also be able to send support requests to ShareEnJoy
 support staff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
\begin_inset Formula $\mathit{ShareEnJoy Control Room}$
\end_inset

 This component is intended to be used by ShareEnJoy operators.
 It will provide a real-time blueprint of the system, the functionalities
 to handle support requests and the possibility to be notified for some
 specific events (e.g.
 an automatic payment failure, a car that runs out of battery).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
\begin_inset Formula $\mathit{ShareEnJoy Core}$
\end_inset

 This component is intended to contain all the system logic.
 It will work as a connection node between all the other components as well
 as connection point to vehicles.
 It will handle user’s payments through a payment gateway and it will perform
 automated tasks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A list of high level goals that the system should accomplish is the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
|G1| The system should know vehicles position and information such as model,
 battery percentage, mechanical issues and damages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
|G2| The system should be able to show on a map the position of available
 vehicles together with some selected status information (e.g.
 battery percentage) and estimated information (e.g.
 kilometers autonomy).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
|G3| Users should be able to register and insert a payment method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
|G4| Users should be able to reserve a vehicle, unlock it when they’re close
 to its position and start the rent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
|G5| The system should charge the users after each rent with fees based
 on company policies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
|G6| Users should be able to send support requests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
|G7| Company operators should be able to handle support requests forwarded
 by users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
|G8| Company operators should be able to see and handle notifications sent
 by the system.

\begin_layout Standard
The central component of the entire system is the ShareEnJoy Core components
 which is where all the logic is put.
 This component of the system is in charge of providing an interface to
 vehicles on-board information system, of processing requests from the other
 components of the system, of accessing system database and of interfacing
 with the payment gateway.

All the other components the system is made of (i.e.
 ShareEnJoy Mobile App and ShareEnJoy Control Room) should interface with
 the core component in order to accomplish required tasks (e.g.
 user’s registration and login, vehicle reservation request, etc).
 They can be considered very thin clients.

 This component will be implemented as a mobile application and it's intended
 for costumers.
 It's important that the most used commands are visibile and easy navigable.
 Secondary commands of less frequent usage can be organised in secondary
 less visible menus.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

In order to avoid mistakes between commands it's better not to have too
 many selections on every page, text explainations should be clear and concise.
 Error windows should show short error descriptions together with an error
 identification code.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline

The application should follow the design guidelines of the different operating
 system it will be implemented for (i.e.
 Material design for Android, ModernUI for iOS) and support all screen resolutio

 This component will be implemented as a web application and it is intended
 for operators.
 All the functionalities should be well categorized and unambiguous.
 Most frequently used functions should be as easy and immediate as possibile
 in order to speed-up operators' work and reduce customers' wait time.
 Some macros could be present in order to reduce repetitve tasks.
 It should be accesible through a common internet connection and it should
 be well optimized for a single chosen browser and screen resolution.
 Error windows should show a long error message in order to easily recover.

Communication Interfaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All components should communicate with the core component in order to complete
 tasks, thus the core component can be seen as an internal API provider.
 All the communications between the components are bidirectional and could
 be implemented through the internet HTTPs protocol using a REST approach.
 Responses could be in the JSON format.

\begin_layout Standard
The system needs to store in the company database customers' personal informatio
n (e.g.
 name, surname, address, email address, telephone number) as well as to
 access users' locations in order to track vehicles.
 Sensible data treatment should respect local laws belonging to each area
 where the service will be available.

Safety and security considerations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Communications between system components should be secure and use advanced
 security protocols in order to avoid man-in-the middle attacks or other
 kind of informatic attacks that could lead to data loss.
\begin_inset Newline newline

Communications towards vehicles should be secured in order to avoid illegal
 vehicles unlocks perfomerd by malicious users or any other type of illegal
 behaviours.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Assumptions and dependencies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system is based on the following domain assumptions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Information provided by vehicles on-board information system to the core
 component are always available and accurate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Vehicles on-board information system are always able to detect and provide:
 battery percentage, number of passengers, mechanical failures, GPS location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If a vehicle cannot obtain location by GPS or has not internet connection
 it is considered unavailable and not shown to users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Vehicles always unlock when the system tells them to unlock.
 This is true for each type of command the system sends to vehicles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If a user has a valid driving license - so his driving license was successfully
 evaluated during the registration process - then he can access the service.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Further developments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Allow the creation of different groups of users in order to have different
 system behaviours based on the group (e.g.
 different pricing policies for different groups).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Allow the creation of coupons that users can use in order to have special
 discounts.

\begin_layout Standard
Luca is a university student who moved to Milan for studying.
 He can’t afford to buy a car but sometimes he needs to move even when public
 transports are unavailable (i.e.
 during the night).
 He decided to try a car sharing service and downloaded ShareEnJoy Mobile
 App in order to use it during the incoming weekend.
 Once the download is complete and the app is installed on his smartphone,
 Luca starts the registration process: first he needs to create an account
 filling-in his name and email address, his mobile phone number, his home
 address and choosing an username.
 Email address is not yet used and username is available, thus he can continue
 inserting his driving license ID: he missed a characters so the application
 shows an error message.
 Luca fixes the mistake and moves on to the latest step in which he is requested
 to insert his credit card information.
 A fee of 0,01EUR is charged on his credit card in order to validate it
 and the registration process is complete.

Luca receives on his email address his password and can now log-in.

 He is taking a train from Malpensa to Stazione Centrale station and during
 the 30 minutes time trip he plans to reserve a vehicle near Stazione Centrale
 in order to do not waste time when he will get off the train.
 He is a ShareEnJoy user and he starts the application on his smartphone:
 he fills in the address and sees available vehicles on the map.
 He founds a vehicle with enough power according to his requirements and
 3 minutes walking from the station.
 He decides to reserve the vehicles and clicks the relative button on the
 application.
 Now Martin can relax until he reaches Stazione Centrale.

Marco is walking home after his evening gym session when he spots a ShareEnJoy
 car parked along the street.
 He is tired by his training session so he decides to check if the car is
 available.
 Marco starts the application on his smartphone and checks for available
 vehicles nearby using his GPS location.
 The vehicle along the street is available so Marco reserves it and, being
 less than 5 meters away from the car, he is able to unlock it using the
 relative button on the application.
 Marco jumps into the car, secures the fast belt and starts the engine:
 the rental starts and the price to be paied is shown on the screen installed
 in the car.

\begin_layout Standard
Mario and his friends are planning to go the the cinema tonight but the
 place they want to reach is not covered by city public transports.
 Mario is an old ShareEnJoy customer and he knows that the place is inside
 the safe area and that ShareEnJoy applies a special discount on the rental
 fee if there are passengers.
 He rents a vehicle and reaches the cinema: once there, he stops the engine
 and terminates the rent.
 An SMS sent to his mobile phone number informs him of the final price,
 which was influenced by a number of company policies.
 9EUR is the base price, plus he has got a 10% discount because he traveled
 with friends, a 20% discount because he left the car with more than 50%
 of the battery capacity available and a 30% extra fee because there are
 no recharging station in a 3KM range from the cinema.
 Mario thinks that 8,43EUR is a very good price to spent a cinema night
 with friends (with which he will divide the cost later!).

 car so that he can reach his friends at the restaurant.
 Mario uses the application on his smartphone to reserve a vehicle but when
 he reaches the car he has an unexpected surprise: the car has no wheels
 because they have been stolen.
 He uses the application to open a support request describing the problem.
 The operator sees the request in the ShareEnJoy Control Room software and
 gives instruction on what to do to the client.
 Then, the operator marks the car as unavailable and sends a notification
 to the mechanics team.

 She wants to reach Rho, a town near Milan, but it is outside the safe area
 and she has not read information documents.
 Once she reaches her destination, she stops the engine and tries to terminate
 the rental: a message on the screen installed in the car and an SMS sent
 to her mobile phone number notifies her that she can't terminate the rent
 in that location and that she will be charged until she will terminate
 the rental inside the safe area.
 Marta checks the map and starts the engine again in order to move the car
 inside the safe area, which is just 700mt away from her destination.
